**Thoughts about the code**
overall code is okay but a lot of improvements can be made to improve its readabilty, scanlabilty, and reducing code duplication. 
structure is fine. creating a controller and calling methods from repository to perform CRUD operations is a good approach. further more seperating Business logic from controller to create service class is also possible. so that controller complexity can be reduced. 

**Booking Controller Refactoring**
Instead of $data = $request->all(); used Laravel's request validation. created Booking Request.
Removed duplicated code and used repository methods.
Method Naming: Renamed some methods to make their purpose clearer.
Ensured consistent response generation.
Calling envrioment variables directly in code is not a good approach. that's why i created config file for it. 
Methods are now calling methods from the repository, promoting the use of interfaces.

**Booking Repository** 
Added some missing methods in repository that are used in booking controller.
Consistent naming convention not followed. for example $cuser, $job_id,
Also constants or enums can be used to reuse named constants. job_type = paid, unpaid, etc. 
used User model instead of doing DB::table('users')
